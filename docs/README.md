# Docs

This repo treats docs as part of the product.

## Folders
- `decisions/` — Architecture Decision Records (ADRs): what we decided + why.
- `changelog/` — weekly “what changed” logs tied to weeks.
- `runbooks/` — how to operate locally and later in CI/CD.
- `architecture/` — evolving system boundaries, diagrams, threat model notes.
