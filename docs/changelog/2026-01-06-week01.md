# Week 01 — Lab scaffold + repo standards (2026-01-06)

## Shipped
- Repo scaffold with `src/`, `tests/`, `docs/`
- Makefile workflow: setup/lint/format/test/run
- Ruff + pytest configured
- ADR-0001 created to lock repo standards
- Runbook + architecture placeholders created
- Configured `src/`-based layout with explicit `PYTHONPATH` handling
- Standardized `uv` workflow using `dependency-groups.dev`


## Notes
Week 01 is intentionally boring. The goal is repeatability and speed later.
- Resolved Python import path issues between pytest and runtime execution
