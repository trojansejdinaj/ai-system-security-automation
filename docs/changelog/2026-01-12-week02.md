# Week 02 — Secrets Model + Rotation Plan (2026-01-12)

## Shipped
- Defined a secrets classification model (application, infrastructure, local)
- Standardized local secrets handling via `.env` and `.env.example`
- Established an event-driven secrets rotation strategy
- Explicitly prohibited secrets in source, tests, logs, or version control

---

## Notes
This week focused on making secrets handling explicit instead of implicit.

No external secrets manager was introduced to avoid premature complexity.
The model is intentionally simple but designed to scale cleanly once
multiple environments or CI/CD pipelines are added.
